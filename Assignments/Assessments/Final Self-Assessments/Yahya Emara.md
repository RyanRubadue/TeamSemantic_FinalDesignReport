## Final Self Reflection - Yahya Emara

### Individual Contribution Summary
During the development of the project, I played a role in various stages. In the initial phase, I was responsible for researching and curating an appropriate dataset for training the model. My efforts in this stage ensured that our team had access to high-quality data, which served as the foundation for the success of our project. Subsequently, I took charge of filtering the data by identifying and implementing the cleanlab filtering technique, which proved to be effective in refining the dataset and enhancing the model's performance.

As the project progressed, I shifted my focus to implementing the UMap algorithm. These techniques allowed us to visualize and analyze the complex relationships within our text data more effectively. Additionally, I was responsible for integrating coherence score and word cloud algorithms into our project pipeline. Working closely with my team, we successfully ran multiple datasets to extract the necessary statistics and make comparisons for all the methods employed in the project. This collaborative effort enabled us to optimize our approach and achieve our desired results.

### Competencies and Skills Learned
Throughout the course of this project, I acquired a diverse set of skills that greatly expanded my knowledge in the field of NLP. By working with PCA and embedding techniques, I gained proficiency in dimensionality reduction and learned how to manipulate long text documents effectively. My experience with text filtering using cleanlab and implementing various NLP and NLTK techniques provided me with a strong foundation in pre-processing and analyzing textual data, setting the stage for further advancements in my career. In addition to the above-mentioned skills, I developed expertise in determining the optimal number of clusters and employing the Tf-Idf algorithm for feature extraction. These abilities allowed me to contribute significantly to the project by ensuring that our results were both accurate and meaningful. Finally, the hands-on experience I gained in developing and evaluating the resulting word clouds enabled me to gain a deeper understanding of the visualization techniques used in NLP. The skills I acquired in this project not only enhanced my expertise in the domain but also prepared me to tackle future challenges in the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing.

Overall, I learned valuable lessons about group work and the dynamics of effective teamwork. Our team excelled in many aspects, particularly in dividing tasks evenly among members and meeting at least once a week to discuss progress, share ideas, and address any challenges. This open communication and collaborative spirit facilitated a productive and supportive environment that fostered creativity and innovation. However, there were instances when our team faced difficulties in coordinating efforts and maintaining a consistent pace of work. This occasionally resulted in delays and required us to reassess our strategies and timelines.

In terms of individual contributions, I found that my efforts on the project were on par with those of my teammates. We all brought our unique skill sets and expertise to the table, which enriched our collective knowledge and enhanced the overall quality of the project. My teammates as well as advisor consistently offered invaluable insights and were always ready to lend a helping hand when needed. Ultimately, our teamwork and shared commitment to the project's success played a critical role in achieving our goals and overcoming the challenges we encountered.
