## Final Self Reflection - Tristan Weger

### Individual Contribution Summary
Throughout this senior design project there were many things that I learned. To start, since I am
an electrical engineer, coming into this year I was unfamiliar with Python. I chose to buckle
down and learn something new and valuable and picked this project along with another Python
based class. I feel throughout this semester I have learned all the basics along with some more
advanced techniques for Python. Overall, these last two semester have helped me become a
better engineer

My personal contribution was helping with all the assignments, coding, collecting data,
analyzing data, storing and visualizing data, and creating the final presentation. I used google
Colab to code and share my code. By using google Colab I was able to better customize what
code I needed to run by splitting it up into code blocks. The assignments were mainly
completed using Microsoft word, notepad, and GitHub. I helped complete or implement all
assignments we had to do. The final presentation was done in Microsoft PowerPoint where I
wrote multiple sections and added the figures along with page configuration. All in all, I have
worked many hours on this project and am proud of what my team and I have done.

### Competencies and Skills Learned

In the end we surpassed our original goal. We were able to cluster documents into a semantic
space early on in the second semester. Through our advisors guidance we were able to
continue on and do even more research into the subject and get additional filtering of sentence
tokens in large documents completed. Our research has been put into a research paper written
by our advisor in hopes of getting published into a machine learning journal. The entire first
semester we did not actually complete much code, most of that was background research,
brainstorming and coming up with project ideas. The second semester is where we really picked
up the work and all put countless full days of working on the project in to get a completed
senior design project along with a paper.

I think our team worked well together overall. For the most part we split assignments or what
needed to be coded into tasks for each of us to complete. We ran the code and adjusted the
code on our own and then pushed it to the main GitHub branch when completed. Questions
that any of us had were quickly answered by other teammates. We worked hard and efficiently
to complete our recommended tasks and goals from our advisor. I think the key to working well
as a team together on this was organization, we stayed well organized and labelled all files and
data as they were completed. This allowed us all to work well and complete our tasks together.
